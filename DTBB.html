                        As part of my Masters Program at DigiPen Institute of Technology,
                        I designed and developed a single player action-adventure game with
                        the focus on driving through arenas filled with objects that can be
                        destroyed and enemies that can be defeated utilizing a custom-made, 
                        component-based 3D Game Engine built with <b>C++,
                        SDL, OpenGL, FMOD and LUA</b>.
                        <br />
                        I collaborated with a team of fellow students to complete this project,
                        working together to bring our individual strengths and expertise to the
                        table in order to create an outstanding final product.

                    <p>Game Design Lead / Audio Lead</p>

                    <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a audio system for the Engine using <b>FMOD</b> core API</li>
                        <li>Integrated a robust game state manager using stack based approach</li>
                        <li>Added Sound Effects, Music to the game</li>
                        <li>Created designs for the layout of the levels using <b>Unity</b></li>

                        <p>The game's options menu displays the controls, which adapt based on whether a controller is connected. 
                            Additionally, within this menu, you can toggle the audio and sound effects on or off.

                            well-being within the game world. A resource count is displayed beneath the health indicator, 
                            enabling players to track their available in-game currency. On the right side, 
                            you'll notice a handy counter that tells you how many more enemies and what type of 
                            enemies you need to defeat before moving on to the next level. It's a helpful way to 
                            keep track of your progress and know how close you are to advancing in the game. 
                            By the way, if you're new to the game, don't worry! Now and then, helpful tips and 
                            hints will pop up on the screen. They'll give you all the essential details about
